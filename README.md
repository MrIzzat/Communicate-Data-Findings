# Communicate-Data-Findings

This project covers topics in [Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/tree/master/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Matplotlib%20and%20Seaborn)

The [original](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/blob/master/Projects/Project%203/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv) and [cleaned](https://github.com/MrIzzat/Data-Analyst-Course/blob/master/Projects/Project%203/cleaned.csv) datasets.

The project was split into two parts, **Exploratory Visualizations** and **Explanatory Visulizations**.

During the exploratory part, two columns were created, distance (using haversine formula ) and age. Univariate, bivariate and 
multivariate visualizations were created, but were not visually polished. Relationships between variables analyzed within the 
visualizations generated. After univariate analysis, some cleaning was done to variables that had outliers.

During the explanatory part, the most informative graphs created during the exploratory analysis were taken, polished and provided with 
insights as well as an explanation.
